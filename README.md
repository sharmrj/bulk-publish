# bulk-publish

Usage:
```
bulk-publish [path to the import report excel file] [owner] [repo] [ref]
```

Extracts paths from the import report generated by the Helix Importer

Currently it will both preview and publish all the paths (you cannot opt out of one or the other).

You may need to do
```
chmod +x path/to/bulk-publish
```
You may also need to go to `System Preferences > Security > Open Anyway `
